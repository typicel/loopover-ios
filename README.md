# Loopover

Loopover is a challenging 2D Rubix Cube style puzzle game. The goal of the game is to slide every box back into its original place. Any box that goes outside the grid will "loopover" back around to the other side. The game can be played in 4 different sizes: 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6. Try to come up with the fastest time for each board!
